            <h3>My Background</h3><br>
            <p>
                So, I was born and raised in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. I grew 
                up in a town about an hour north of Philadelphia. I have two 
                older siblings. Both of my parents work in the dental field and 
                they used to have their own dental office. We enjoy going to the
                beach and the lake (we like being near the water).

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3><br>
            <p>
                I don't have a ton of different hobbies but my main ones 
                are playing soccer and video games (watching and playing). I 
                snowboard in the winter sometimes and I used to surf in the 
                summer. I'm thinking about picking up painting or drawing, that
                seems fun!

            <h3>My Goals</h3><br>
            <p>
                Someday, I would like to become a web developer just so I can 
                understand how mark-up and progamming languages work. I hope I 
                can work for a company someday and work in-person with other 
                developers: seems like a cool environment. Perhaps, if I become
                lucky or skilled enough, I will have the privilege of developing
                a game for Naughty Dog or Bethesda.
